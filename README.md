* Setup Flutter SDK [Flutter Link](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* This is not recommeded for new peoples but if you are following old project in flutter use FVM to manage flutter version. [FVM Link](https://pub.dev/packages/fvm)
* Setup emulator or real mobile devices for app testing in flutter. (enable USB-Debugging for mobile devices testing).

## Setup Flutter

* Try to learn HTTp calls. Use package like [HTTP](https://pub.dev/packages/http) or [DIO](https://pub.dev/packages/dio). Its better to learn with HTTP then lern Dio. In production apps or big project is better to use Dio.
* Dio a project with Http or dio.
* Try to learn any of the state Managment Like [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc), [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get), [Riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod).
* Try to do a project using state managment and follow a structure like MVC.
* Learn about dependency Injection like [Get It](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it).
* Try to learn about database in flutter like [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite), [Shared preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences), [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive). (If you are learning Hive its better to follow youtube videos. Try to learn adapter in Hive).
